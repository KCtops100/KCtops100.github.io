                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    In "Infinite Horizons," resource generation revolves around using the Create Sifter to process various blocks through different meshes. Depending on the material and mesh tier, you can obtain essential resources, from basic materials like iron and copper to advanced ores and mystical items crucial for progression. Below is an overview of what you can expect from processing different blocks.
                </p>
                
                <ul>

                <h3>Basic Resources</h3>
                <p>
                    Gathering inferium essense is the same as usual, but there are obviously no ores so you can get it through mob drops.<br>
                    To gather prosperity shards, you need to come up with a basic resource generator described in the "Automation" section.  Specifically, you need to sift dust to gather prosperity shards.
                </p>
