                <p>
                    Gathering inferium essense is the same as usual, but there are obviously no ores so you can get it through mob drops.
                    To gather prosperity shards, you need to come up with a basic resource generator described in the "Automation" section.  Specifically, you need to sift dust to gather prosperity shards.<br>
