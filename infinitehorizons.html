                <p>
                    Gathering inferium essense is the same as usual, but there are obviously no ores so you can get it through mob drops.<br>
                    To gather prosperity shards, you need to come up with a basic resource generator described in the "Automation" section.  Specifically, you need to sift dust to gather prosperity shards.
