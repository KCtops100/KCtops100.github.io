                <h3>Basic Resources</h3>
                <p>
                    Gathering inferium essense is the same as usual, but there are obviously no ores so you can get it through mob drops.<br>
                    To gather prosperity shards, you need to come up with a basic resource generator described in the "Automation" section.  Specifically, you need to sift dust to gather prosperity shards.
                </p>
                <h3>Agromancer Villager</h3>
                <p>
                    To unlock the elemental tier essences (air, earth, fire, water) and others, you need to craft a new villager workstation exclusive to "Infinite Horizons" which is the Agromancer's Workbench.<br>
                    The recipe is below as follows:<br>
                    <img src="agromancerworkbench.JPG" alt="Agromancer's Workstation Recipe"><br><br>
                    To summarize, the following items can be traded from this villager:<br>
                    - Level 1 Trades:<br>
                    &emsp;- Inferium essence from emeralds<br>
                    &emsp;- The elemental essences (air, earth, fire, water) from emeralds and inferium essence<br>

                    &emsp;- Nature essence from earth and water essence<br>
                    &emsp;- Ice essence from inferium and water essence<br>
